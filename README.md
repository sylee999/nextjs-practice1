## Project Overview

This project, named `nextjs-practice1`, serves as a learning platform for AI-driven development and prompt engineering. It implements basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) features for entities like users, posts, comments, and likes, utilizing [mockapi.io](https://mockapi.io/) for API interactions.

## Key Technologies

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS, ShadCN
- **Testing**: Vitest, React Testing Library
- **API**: mockapi.io
- **Hosting**: Vercel
- **Package Manager**: npm

## Project Context

The primary goal is to practice AI-assisted development and refine prompt engineering skills while building a simple CRUD application using modern web technologies. This project aims to enhance understanding of AI tool capabilities in software development and provide a structured approach to learning API integration.

## System Patterns

The architecture employs Client-Side Rendering (CSR) for dynamic UI updates and Server-Side Rendering (SSR) where needed for SEO improvements. It follows an API-based architecture with mockapi.io. Key technical decisions include using Next.js for routing and performance optimizations, TailwindCSS & ShadCN for fast and consistent UI styling, and npm for dependency management. The design patterns include Component-Based Development, Separation of Concerns, and Reusable Utility Functions.

## Development Setup

To get started with development:

1. Install Node.js and npm.
2. Create a Next.js app with TypeScript.
3. Configure TailwindCSS and ShadCN.
4. Set up Vitest for testing.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

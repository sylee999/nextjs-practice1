# System Patterns

## Architecture

- **Client-Side Rendering (CSR)** for dynamic UI updates.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** where needed for SEO improvements.
- **API-based architecture** with mockapi.io.

## Key Technical Decisions

- Next.js for routing and performance optimizations.
- TailwindCSS & ShadCN for fast and consistent UI styling.
- npm as the package manager for dependency management.

## Design Patterns

- **Component-Based Development** (React functional components).
- **Separation of Concerns** (data fetching, UI components, state management).
- **Reusable Utility Functions** for API interactions.

## Component Relationships

- **Pages**: Users, Posts, Comments, Likes.
- **Components**: Forms, Lists, Cards, Modals.
- **State Management**: React hooks for local state.

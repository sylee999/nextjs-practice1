## Entity Relationships
- A User can have multiple Posts (one-to-many)
- A User can follow multiple Users (many-to-many)
- A User can bookmark multiple Posts (many-to-many)
- A Post belongs to a User (many-to-one)
- A Post can be bookmarked by multiple Users (many-to-many)

## API Operations
### User Operations
- Create, Read, Update, Delete users
- View all posts by a user
- Follow/unfollow users
- View followers of a user
- View users that a user is following
- View bookmarked posts by a user

### Post Operations
- Create, Read, Update, Delete posts
- Bookmark/unbookmark posts
- View all users who bookmarked a post

## Data Storage Constraints
- **REST API Limitations**: No additional entities can be created beyond User and Post
- **No Transactions**: All related data updates must be handled sequentially
- **Array-based Relationships**: All many-to-many relationships stored as arrays in both entities
- **Dual Updates Required**: Follow/bookmark operations require updating both related entities

## Implementation Notes
### Follow Functionality
- When User A follows User B:
  - Add User B's ID to User A's `following` array
  - Add User A's ID to User B's `followers` array
- Both updates must be performed in sequence with proper error handling

### Bookmark Functionality  
- When User bookmarks Post:
  - Add Post ID to User's `bookmarkedPosts` array
  - Add User ID to Post's `bookmarkedBy` array
- Both updates must be performed in sequence with proper error handling

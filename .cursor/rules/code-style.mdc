# Code Style & Naming Conventions

## General Guidelines
- Use ESLint + Prettier for formatting
- Follow Next.js and React naming and style conventions
- Keep files focused and with a single responsibility
- Use TypeScript for all files

## Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for React components
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and instance methods
- Use kebab-case for file names
- Use ALL_CAPS for constants
- Use descriptive, intention-revealing names

## Component Structure
- Place styles with Tailwind classes directly in components
- Group related components in subdirectories
- Keep components small and focused
- Extract reusable components to `/components` directory
- Use named exports for components

## TypeScript
- Define types in `/types` directory
- Use interfaces for object shapes
- Use descriptive names for type definitions
- Avoid `any` type as much as possible
- Use generics where appropriate

## API Calls
- Wrap all REST calls in `/lib/api.ts`
- Use proper error handling for API calls
- Implement proper loading states
- Use TypeScript interfaces for API responses

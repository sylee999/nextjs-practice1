# Project Structure Guidelines

## Directory Structure
```text
/src
  /app         # Next.js pages using App Router
  /components  # React components
  /lib         # Utility functions and API wrapper
  /types       # TypeScript type definitions
/public        # Static assets
```

## App Directory
- Follow Next.js App Router conventions
- Organize by route/feature
- Place layout components in appropriate directories
- Use loading.tsx for loading states
- Use error.tsx for error boundaries

## Components Directory
- Organize by feature or component type
- Keep components small and focused
- Create subdirectories for complex components
- Include tests alongside components

## Lib Directory
- Place API wrapper in `/lib/api.ts`
- Group utility functions by domain
- Keep utility functions pure when possible
- Write tests for all utility functions

## Types Directory
- Define shared interfaces and types
- Use descriptive names for type definitions
- Export types from a central index file
- Keep type definitions DRY

## Public Directory
- Only place static assets here
- Organize assets by type (images, fonts, etc.)
- Use optimized image formats (WebP, SVG)
- Keep file sizes small
